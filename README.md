<p><h1>More About Me</h1>
<details>
    <summary> My Life in Scottish Places </summary>
    <p>I was born in East Kilbride, grew up in Aberdeen and then, once I met my partner, I moved to a tiny island on the west coast for a year with him. When we were expecting our first child, we moved back to Aberdeenshire. Ten years later, with two kids, we moved to Edinburgh where we've lived for nine years. Next year we plan to move to Glasgow, close to where I was born. There now aren't many places in Scotland left that I haven't experienced a little bit - or a lot! </p>
